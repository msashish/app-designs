## Problem

    Given an array of integers, determine if array is monotonic.
    Return True if monotonic, otherwise False
    
    Definition: Monotonic means either the array is in increasing order or in decreasing order

### Assumptions

    1) By increasing order we mean next element >= current element
    2) By decreasing order we mean current element >= next element

### Examples

    [1, 2, 5, 5, 8] → True
    [1, 4, 5, 6, 3] → False
